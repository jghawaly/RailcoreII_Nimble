# RailcoreII_Nimble
Cura 4 slicer settings for Railcore II 300ZL with the Zesty Nimble Extruder, with PLA or TPU (Shore 90 or higher) filament. This is meant to act as a starting point, as different hardware will require individual fine-tuning. 

**Notes**:
* This profile should be compatible with layer heights between 100 and 200 microns. For layer heights lower than 100 microns, I suggest lowering the print speed to 40 mm/s. 
* The flow percentage may need to be adjusted to your individual filament. I have found 97% to be adequate for Esun PLA+ filament that I normally use.
* The support settings are optimized for 100 or 200 micron layer heights. If you use a layer height of 50 microns, I suggest lowering the Support Z Distance to 100 microns.
